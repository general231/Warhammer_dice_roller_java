# Warhammer 40K Dice Statistics

This is a project that calculates dice statistics for Warhammer 40K

## Warning
The exe in release hasnt been signed so it will give a big scary warning on windows. I promise its fine, but I am some random on the internet. You can run it with the exe, or by directly running the .jar file or to be 100% sure just build this yourself.
```
java -jar shadow.jar
```

## Getting Started

This is currently setup for Java 8, just run gradle and it should build

### Prerequisites

If using Java 8 it should just work, if you are using a more recent version e.g. 11 or 13 then you will need to add JavaFX


### Installing

Build with Gradle

```
gradle build
```

then launch the jar file, it will create a fat jar with shadow
```
Java -jar shadow.jar
```
or run with gradle
```
gradle run
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
